Objective: 
  Integrate crop simulation (BioCro) and biomass supply chain optimziation (BioScope) models to provide decision support on strategic planning of biomass supply chain configurations considering spatio-temporal changes of crop yield and other uncertainties.

Deliverables:
  Multi-year biomass supply chain optimization considering spatio-temporal changes:  
    Factors to be considered: changes of crop yield, cropland usage rate, and transportation costs.
    
  Stochastic BioScope model development: Multi-year stochastic optimizaiton model to minimize expected provision costs
  BioCro model: multi-year grid based 0.25 degree yield prediction of Miscanthus

Scenarios:
  15-Year planning span
  Biomass resources: Miscanthus, Corn stover, and mixed feedstock provision
  Cost comparison of these three scenarios
